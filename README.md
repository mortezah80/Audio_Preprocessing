### File Descriptions:

#### `db_rttm.py`:
- **Description**: This Python script is responsible for processing audio files and extracting segments based on provided annotations. It then combines these segments into a single audio file.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reads annotations from a file containing start and end times of segments.
  - Extracts audio segments based on the provided time intervals.
  - Combines the extracted segments into a single audio file.
  - Exports the combined audio file in WAV format.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `pydub`, `re`

#### `label_covert.py`:
- **Description**: This Python script processes label files to extract speech segments and generate RTTM and UEM entries.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reads label files and extracts speech segments based on specified conditions.
  - Generates RTTM entries for speech segments and UEM entries for entire audio files.
  - Writes the generated RTTM and UEM entries to corresponding files.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `os`, `math`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pydub`, `pyannote.core`, `pyannote.audio`, `struct`, `torchaudio`, `soundfile`, `torch`, `urllib`, `scipy.io.wavfile`, `pydub`, `librosa`

#### `calculate_erorr.py`:
- **Description**: This Python script performs diarization error rate (DER) evaluation between predicted speaker segments and reference segments. It utilizes the `pyannote` library for diarization error rate calculation.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reads predicted speaker segments from text files.
  - Reads reference speaker segments from RTTM (Rich Transcription Time Marked) files.
  - Calculates the diarization error rate (DER) using `pyannote.metrics.diarization.DiarizationErrorRate`.
  - Prints detailed results for each audio sample and the final aggregated result.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `pyannote`
- **Input**:
  - Predicted speaker segments: Text files containing start and end times of speaker segments (e.g., `sample.txt`).
  - Reference speaker segments: RTTM files containing start and end times of speaker segments (e.g., `sample.rttm`).
- **Output**:
  - Detailed results for each audio sample, including total, correct, missed detection, false alarm, and diarization error rate.
  - Final aggregated result including total, correct, missed detection, false alarm, and average diarization error rate across all samples.
 

#### `segment_analysis.py`:
- **Description**: This Python script calculates the duration and distribution of different segments (noises, short speech, and medium speech) based on speaker segments provided in an RTTM (Rich Transcription Time Marked) file.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reads speaker segments from an RTTM file.
  - Analyzes the duration and distribution of different segments (noises, short speech, and medium speech).
  - Computes the percentage of time spent on each segment category.
  - Prints the results including the percentage of time spent on noises, short speech, and medium speech, as well as the total duration of segments.
- **Input**:
  - RTTM file (`your_file.rttm`) containing information about speaker segments.
- **Output**:
  - Percentage of time spent on noises.
  - Percentage of time spent on short speech.
  - Percentage of time spent on medium speech.
  - Total duration of all segments.
- **Usage**: Run the script in the directory containing the RTTM file to analyze the speaker segments and compute the segment distribution.

 
### Note:
- These scripts are designed for specific tasks related to audio processing and annotation generation. Ensure to customize them according to your specific requirements.
- Make sure to provide the correct file paths and adjust the scripts as necessary for your dataset and annotation needs.
